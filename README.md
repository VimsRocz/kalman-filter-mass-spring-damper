This repository contains a Python implementation of a Kalman Filter applied to a Mass-Spring-Damper system. It demonstrates real-time simulation, state estimation, and visualization of system behavior under noisy conditions using interactive plots.
# Kalman Filter with Mass-Spring-Damper System

## Overview

This project implements a **Kalman Filter** for state estimation in a Mass-Spring-Damper system. It simulates real-time dynamics, measurements with noise, and uses the Kalman Filter for accurate state estimation.

Key features include:
- User-defined system parameters via a GUI.
- Real-time plotting with interactive visualization.
- Observable system validation.
- Adjustable simulation limits.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulation**: Dynamic, real-time plots of true states, noisy measurements, and Kalman Filter estimates.
- **Customizable System**: Define system masses, spring constants, damping coefficients, and external force.
- **Observability Check**: Ensures system observability before running the Kalman Filter.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kalman-filter-mass-spring-damper.git
   cd kalman-filter-mass-spring-damper
